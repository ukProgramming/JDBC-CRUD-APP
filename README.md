# JDBC-CRUD-APP
Title: JDBC CRUD App - Console-based

Description:
This project is a Console-based Java application that demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). The application allows users to interact with a relational database, perform data manipulation operations, and retrieve information through a command-line interface.

Features:
1. Create: Users can insert new records into the database by providing the required data via the console input.
2. Read: The application supports fetching data from the database based on user-specified criteria and displays the results in the console.
3. Update: Users can modify existing records in the database by providing updated values for specific fields.
4. Delete: The application allows users to delete records from the database using unique identifiers.

Database Connection:
The JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API is utilized to establish a connection to the database, perform queries, and handle transactions. Users can configure the database connection parameters (such as URL, username, and password) within the application to connect to their preferred database system.

Usage:
1. Clone the repository to the local machine.
2. Configure the database connection properties in the application.
3. Compile and run the Java application using a command-line interface.
4. Follow the prompts on the console to perform CRUD operations.

This project serves as a starting point for those learning JDBC and exploring database interactions in a Java application. Developers can build upon this code to create more sophisticated applications or integrate it with other components to suit their specific needs.
